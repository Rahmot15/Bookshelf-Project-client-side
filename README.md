## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Frontend Setup (Client-Side)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rahmat15/Bookshelf-Project-client-side.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Bookshelf-Project-client-side
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root of your project directory, create a file named `.env` and add your Firebase configuration details and your backend API URL. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```
    # Firebase Configuration
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

    # Backend API URL
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your deployed backend URL
    ```
    *Note: The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to your backend server. If running locally, it's typically `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port your backend runs on).*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be running locally, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend Setup

This project relies on a separate backend server for data management and JWT authentication. Please refer to the backend repository for setup instructions:

*   **Backend Repository:** [https://github.com/Rahmot15/Bookshelf-Project-server-side.git](YOUR_BACKEND_REPO_URL)
    *   *Replace `YOUR_BACKEND_REPO_URL` with the actual link to your Express.js/Node.js backend repository.*
